-improvements to Reporting channel interface
    -ErrorInformation object passed in provides name, version, exe name, etc. so that they can be overridden and controlled centrally. Reporting channels should never have to look these up.

    -removed uneeded generic from interface
    -converted to abstract class instead of interface to provide new capabilites
    -additional capabilites for reporting channels:
        -can now set or opt out of async timeout limit
        -can opt into reporting failures through internal reporting system
        -now has an opportunity to register itself as a listener for events emitted by the error reporter.
