# System Colors for NodeJS
This module provides the Windows system colors and high contrast state. It triggers a callback
when the state changes.

## Building

### Prereqs
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** from [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
    - Make sure to install the **VC++ SDK**
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

Refer to [node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) for additional troubleshooting.

### Build
To build, open the **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** and run:
```
cd path\to\repo
npm i
```

## Testing
Currently, there is no test which will automate turning on/off high-contrast on the system. But,
there is a test which will report to the console while the user manually switches the theme.
```
node test.js
```
First, the test will output the current high-contrast state and theme colors.

When someone manually changes the high-contrast theme in **PC Settings**, the console output
should update to the new state.
